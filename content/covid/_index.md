<h4>MQM 2022 and COVID-19</h4>

Virginia Tech is located in a small city (Blacksburg, Virginia, population
43,000) set in a sparsely populated area.  At the time of the conference, most
Virginia Tech students will be far away from Blacksburg enjoying summer
vacation.  As of August 2021, all Virginia Tech faculty, staff, and students
were required to be vaccinated or submit to regular testing.<br/><br/>

Please note that, as of June 12, 2022, the U.S. <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel/index.html">no
longer requires</a> air passengers traveling from a foreign country to the
United States to show a negative COVID-19 viral test or documentation of
recovery from COVID-19 before they board their flight.

<br/>
Virginia Tech is strongly committed to providing a thoroughly safe and healthy
community.
