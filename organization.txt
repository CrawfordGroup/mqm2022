Creating new pages?

speaker page handled as:
  layouts/speaker/list.html  <-- page structure generation
  content/speaker/_index.md  <-- aggregate list text
  content/speaker/speaker-n.md <-- content for each speaker

honoree pages:
  layouts/honoree/list.html    <-- aggregate page structure generation
  layouts/honoree/single.html  <-- individual page structure generation
  layouts/index.html  <-- contains code to generate honoree data for homepage
  content/honoree/_index.md  <-- content for an aggregate page that is not
                                 explicitly linked
  content/honoree/honoree-n.md <-- individual data used for both agreegate
                                    and individual pages
  assets/scss/style.scss <-- imports _honoree.scss
  assets/scss/pages/_honoree.scss <-- defines styles for single-honoree,
                                      .honorees-full-width (unused?)
  assets/scss/pages/_home.scss <-- defines styles for honorees section of
                                   homepage
